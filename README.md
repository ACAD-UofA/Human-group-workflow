# Human-group-workflow
A philosophical overview of everything technical that we do from lab to bioinformatics (discussions from 2022 humans group)

## 1 - From Bone to DNA
### Lab
This is pre-PCR work, done in ancient DNA lab with following anti-contamination protocols.

### Bones
- Most often teeth are used, usually the roots
- petrous bone (dense bone with good DNA preservation, part of the inner ear structure) 
- humerous, rib or other bones are less common but can be used.

Bone extraction is messy, so must be careful not to cross-contaminate. Change gloves and clean a lot etc. 

1. Clean with bleach & alcohol (only teeth)
2. scraping off the surface
3. Cut crown away from the root with disk dremel (in laminar flow hood) or cut the part of the cochlea 
4. Try to get rid of dental pulp (the part where blood goes and most bactieria are). 
5. Pulverise into powder at room temperature and use powder for DNA extraction


### DNA Extraction 
Two day protocol
Day One:
1. Input 0.1g bone powder to extraction & keep the rest as backup powder. more powder could result in more quantity of DNA and better complexity theoretically.
2. Pre-digestion with EDTA 
3. EDTA (breaks calcium) + proteinase K (degrade protein) - overnight incubation.

Day Two:
1. Add silica in tube and spin down, remove supernatant 
2. Silica binds DNA (Silica is broad range so good for capturing short molecules, like aDNA)
3.  with binding buffer
4. Many ethanol washes
5. Elute DNA from silica with TLE and 50Â°C heat
6. Result = "Stock solution" and "working solution"
7. Quantify

For every extraction batch, do an EBC or Extraction Blank Control, to test underlying contamination of the lab \
- Scoop air from the hood into empty tube, treat as if it is a sample following the same protocol
