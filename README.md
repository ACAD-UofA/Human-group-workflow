# Human-group-workflow
A philosophical overview of everything technical that we do from lab to bioinformatics (discussions from 2022 humans group)

## 1 - From Bone to DNA

trambarn, pre-pcr & clean lab
teeth (usually roots), petrous, (get pics), humerous and rib bones are less common but can be used
bone extraction is messy, so careful not to contaminate. Change gloves and clean a lot etc. 

first clean with bleach & alcohol, then cut crown away from the root with disk dremel (in laminar flow hood).

try to get rid of dental pulp (the part where blood goes and most bactieria are). use vibrating cone thing to pulverise pulp - apparently good for getting rid of infections the person may have had
pulverise into powder and use that for DNA extraction

Petrous bone- dense bone with good DNA preservation, part of the inner ear structure

bone pulverisor kind of like a piston, done at room temp
input 0.1g bone powder to extraction, leave the rest as backup powder. more powder could result in more quantity of DNA and better complexity theoretically.
2 day protocol
proteinase k degrades protein
EDTA breaks calcium - overnight incubation.

2nd day - silica in tube and spin down, remove supernatant (new protocol with beads out though) binds DNA (broad range so good for capturing short molecules

then lots of cleaning with binding buffer, many ethanol washes
elute dna from silica with te and heat

end up with master stock and cleaning stock, 
quantify and done :)

Extraction Blank Control = scoop air from the hood into empty tube, and treat as if it is a sample, to have a control for underlying lab contamination.
